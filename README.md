# N-Body-Simulation-Experiment

This code simulates the solar system up to and inculding Saturn.

These classes work together to find to run three experiments.  The first calculates the orbital periods of each planet and then compares them to standard values and computes the difference.

The second experiment measures the total energy of the system to check for energy conservation.  It does so with two different algorithms, the Beeman method and the Direct-Euler method.

The third experiment calculates the time taken for planetary alignment to occur up until Jupiter.
